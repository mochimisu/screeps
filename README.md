# mochimisu screeps scripts
Playing [screeps](https://screeps.com/) as [mochimisu](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/mochimisu) on shard3.

This repo was started using the [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) template.

## Setup
1a. `direnv` with `nix` will set up the environment. You must run `direnv allow` in the root directory to allow the `.envrc` file to be loaded.
1b. Or, if you aren't using `nix`, install `node` and `yarn`
2. Run `npm install` and `yarn` to install dependencies

## Development
- `npm run watch-main` to watch and upload to the main server
- `npm run push-main` to push once to the main server
(see [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter)
